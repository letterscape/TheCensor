      <div><h1 id="heading-genesis">Genesis</h1>
      <p>We started Foundation with the vision of empowering digital creators with crypto. We were guided by the belief that tokens and smart contracts would become powerful tools in the hands of creative people on the internet. In our minds, the artists, musicians and storytellers of the world would realize crypto’s true potential.</p>
      <p>It turns out we were right. Since our founding, Foundation has facilitated the sale of hundreds of millions of dollars of digital art across every medium and genre imaginable. Memes, music videos, animation, generative art, illustration, photography and AI-generated imagery have all found a vibrant home on Foundation.</p>
      <p>In early 2020, when Foundation was first getting off the ground, our vision felt distant because there were very few artists seriously engaged with crypto as a medium. Crypto was an alien technology with little to no mainstream appeal. To make the technology more palatable, we attempted to abstract it away — to make it invisible.</p>
      <p>In the process, we learned an important lesson: <a href="https://foundation.app/blog/crypto-wants-to-be-seen" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto wants to be seen</a>. Abstraction led to poor user comprehension, and, in turn, poor engagement and retention. In an abrupt pivot, we opted to invite our early community to engage with the technology directly, and something marvelous happened: things started to click. One by one, artists and collectors started to see crypto’s true promise: immutable, eternal provenance, digital ownership, and global markets denominated in a currency native to the internet.</p>
      <p>When compared with 2020, the space has made enormous progress but we also acknowledge that the space hasn’t grown tremendously since its big bang moment in 2021. We believe the space is ready for its next leap forward. <strong>And the next leap forward entails moving the digital art ecosystem to Ethereum L2.</strong></p>
      <h1 id="heading-ethereum-l2">Ethereum L2</h1>
      <p>Ethereum, the substrate from which NFTs are spawned, is itself changing. The Ethereum community isn’t settling for a world in which users need to pay $50 or $100 to transact. That was never the vision. Ethereum’s <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">roadmap</a> dictates that it will evolve beyond its origins as a single, all-purpose chain into a network of rollup chains.</p>
      <p>These rollups create new layers for experimentation, exploration and discovery, unbridled from the prohibitive expense of mainnet while still inheriting its technical architecture, security and base currency.</p>
      <p>While the digital art market is still rooted on Ethereum mainnet, its future is inevitably on Ethereum L2 where orders of magnitude more collectors will be able to transact, participate and grow enamored with digital art. What’s clear from the exploits of <a href="https://app.manifold.xyz/c/spores-mutatio" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">xcopy</a>, <a href="https://highlight.xyz/mint/65d4c33f139818e311c5011e" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Zancan</a> and <a href="https://zora.co/collect/base:0x82e30a63bccde3724877878a30c4977b52348198/1" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jack Butcher</a> is that collector interest has never been higher. What’s been in the way has been transaction costs. Crypto doesn’t just want to be seen, it wants to be used, and high gas fees are at odds with such a clearly stated desire.</p>
      <h1 id="heading-cryptos-broadband-era">Crypto’s broadband era</h1>
      <p>People often look to the physical art world as a comparison to guide their thinking about what’s possible in digital art. There’s certainly credence to that approach. Digital art and physical art are both bound by provenance. But it’s not sufficient. NFTs are equally internet as much as they are art. And the internet has unique properties that set it apart from the physical world.</p>
      <p>Crypto is undergoing a transition that has clear precedence in previous cycles of technological evolution. The mainframe preceded personal computing. Dial-up modems preceded broadband internet. L1 to L2 is a transformation on the same scale, which should invite enormous confidence in the future of web3 and digital art because on the other side is a step change increase in adoption, utility, and societal impact.</p>
      <p>Very few early internet users could have predicted how ubiquitous and far-reaching the internet would become once we all had broadband internet connections. L2 will be similarly impactful.</p>
      <h1 id="heading-l2-first">L2-first</h1>
      <p>Foundation has always operated with the assumption that L2 would scale Ethereum and become the default user experience for the vast majority of users.</p>
      <p>It’s why we elected to put our marketplace and creator tooling onchain despite the cost to both us and our community. We understood that onchain was the right long-term architecture and that gas costs would be addressed by innovation at the L2 layer. That’s precisely what happened with <a href="https://www.eip4844.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">EIP-4844</a>, which went live on March 14, enshrining rollups on L1 and dropping gas fees to pennies on L2.</p>
      <p>It’s why we experimented with <a href="https://foundation.app/blog/building-on-the-edge" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">xDai</a> early in our journey to understand the limitations of the technology at the time. What we learned in 2020 served us for years: artists and collectors first needed to appreciate the value prop of L1 before making the conceptual leap to L2. You can’t sell someone on a faster car if they don’t understand why they need a car in the first place.</p>
      <p>All of which is to say, we’re all in. We have every reason to believe that the time to move to L2 is now. Rollups have made significant technical progress. They operate in production with billions of dollars at stake. And most importantly, the digital art community is hungry for a new frontier.</p>
      <h1 id="heading-inaction-isnt-in-our-dna">Inaction isn’t in our DNA</h1>
      <p>L2s aren’t perfect:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>It’ll take time for <a href="https://www.veradiverdict.com/p/decentralized-sequencers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">sequencers</a> to fully decentralize</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Bridging presents new security risks</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>There are UX challenges to overcome with wallets</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But these are all solvable challenges. The risk of doing nothing is far graver. The number of people interested in collecting digital art on L1 is stagnant (and has been for years). Without embracing L2, we’d be forced to accept that the digital art market would remain confined to its current size, which feels like a failure of imagination when L2s exist and continue to evolve at a breakneck pace.</p>
      <p>Inaction isn’t in our DNA. We’re committed to growing the space. The decision to expand beyond the restrictive confines of Ethereum L1 is imperative, which is why starting today, Foundation is committed to becoming L2-first.</p>
      <h1 id="heading-a-commitment-to-explore-the-medium-fully">A commitment to explore the medium fully</h1>
      <p>L2s challenge us to answer new and interesting questions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>What were artists and collectors not doing because of high gas costs?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>What does a digital art ecosystem with millions of participants look and feel like? How does it diverge from what we’ve prototyped on L1?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>What sacred truths no longer apply?</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’re committed to answering each of these questions. We’re committed to exploring the medium fully.</p>
      <p>Just as early internet pioneers fiddled with modems to log on to an early internet that any modern citizen would find unimaginably slow and limited, so too will future crypto citizens look back at our early days on L1 in a similar light.</p>
      <p>L2s open the door to crypto’s broadband era. Today, we pass through it, never to look back. In 2021, crypto wanted to be seen. In 2024, crypto wants to be used.</p>
      <hr>
      <p><em>Thank you to Nat Emodi of Highlight and Jacob Horne of Zora for their help in crafting some of the language laid out in this article. You both have been true pioneers of Ethereum L2.</em></p></div>

      <div><p>I went on a vacation in Cyprus and was surprised by the use of crypto in the payments and money transfers. The more surprising thing to me was seeing that no one uses Ethereum or L2 for payments, and almost all of them use Tron only. I had a chance to talk with the local exchange owners and want to summarize their thoughts on Ethereum &amp; L2 &amp; payments in general.</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="A Local Exchange - No Ethereum Logo in Their Table 🙂  " loading="lazy" width="1174" height="498" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:1174px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/w_7P-F1MWS3m9STxqoBre.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>A Local Exchange - No Ethereum Logo in Their Table 🙂  </figcaption></figure></div>
      <p><strong>No Narrative, Touch the Users: Payments.</strong></p>
      <p>Our industry loves new narratives, especially if it’s about infrastructure. However, when we look at the reality, no infrastructure project has a product that touches users. It stands out as one of the “best” use cases that found its PMF and can touch the end users. What users call payment is a stablecoin transfer, and unfortunately, Tron is one of the leaders right now in the economic activity of stable coin payments. Most stablecoin transfers are happening on Tron, which is a highly centralized and expensive (fee is 1$) chain.</p>
      <p>In Tron’s earlier days, Tron and Binance were working together (I don’t know why), and sending stable coins with Tron was free on Binance Exchanges. Everyone used TRC20 addresses as it has zero fee. Tron also made a massive operation in the African market with Binance in the earlier days of the adoption, and they’re the leader in the African market. According to <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/africa-cryptocurrency-adoption/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Chainalysis</a>, Nigeria stands out as a leader in the adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) volume over-the-counter markets, underlining the country's innovative approach to cryptocurrency use and its pivotal role in the digital finance landscape of Africa.</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="Nigeria Crypto Volume on Exchanges, Data Source Chainanalysis" loading="lazy" width="1534" height="1046" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:1534px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/36YdwW_vEqKtyA--fSMAd.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>Nigeria Crypto Volume on Exchanges, Data Source Chainanalysis</figcaption></figure></div>
      <p>Why do Africa, Nigeria and other driving markets matter? Stable Coins solve a real pain for users in developing markets: Accessing global dollar liquidity and sending money globally. <a href="http://www.starkibris.net/index.asp?haberID=290750" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">And as Cyprus’s one of the local newspapers say</a>, more than 30k Nigerian students are already in Cyprus which led Crypto adoption in Cyprus. These users are more powerful than everyone thinks.</p>

      <p><strong>State of Crypto in Cyprus:</strong></p>
      <p>Northern Cyprus, officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), is a de facto state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. It is recognized only by Turkey, and its territory is considered by all other states to be part of the Republic of Cyprus. Thus, sending and receiving money from other countries is so problematic. During my vacation, I saw more than&nbsp; 20 local crypto exchanges that allow the conversion of stablecoins to local currencies with 1-2% fees, but who were the main customers of these exchanges? African Students, and Gamblers and users who use payments for daily life :)</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="Bitcoin Accepted here - They accept payments in stable coins, which are primarily driven by Tron." loading="lazy" width="1172" height="608" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:1172px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4yZy_Ocl16n6wdpSWjcT5.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>Bitcoin Accepted here - They accept payments in stable coins, which are primarily driven by Tron.</figcaption></figure></div>
      <p><strong>African Students and “Why” They Use Crypto for Cross-Border Money Transfer:</strong> There are a lot of African Students (more than 30k whereas the total Cyprus population is 350k.) in Cyprus, and as they’re students, they need to receive money from their families. Before crypto, it was a huge pain for them because they had to open a bank account and then receive money with huge fees + long waiting times.</p>
      <p>During the talk with the local exchange owner who opened the exchange about seven years ago, he said that African students were one of the OGs on Bitcoin due to global money transfers. After Tron’s huge marketing and BD efforts in Africa, they became a Tron user in the earlier days of the Tron.</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="A Game Center but it also supports stable coin exchange with local currencies" loading="lazy" width="1174" height="660" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:1174px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Qo0d-JcV-rMj-hGagWBul.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>A Game Center but it also supports stable coin exchange with local currencies</figcaption></figure></div>
      <p>Since the students were using Tron for payments, the exchange owner suggested Tron for their other customers as well. I saw a scenario in which I saw the network effect with my own eyes: I was inside a local exchange, and African students were there as always. One Turkish citizen came inside and said that he wanted to sell his car to his friend but he had no bank account. The Exchange owner helped him to be a Tron user and The Turkish Citizen left the exchange with being a Tron user. He will also probably use Tron in Turkey too.</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="Payment Options: Tron and Binance Pay are at the front." loading="lazy" width="2072" height="1108" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:2072px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kWI8AxYaaN26cOlMJuu1Q.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>Payment Options: Tron and Binance Pay are at the front.</figcaption></figure></div>
      <p>I guess this is how Tron created a huge network effect and I also asked this question to the exchange owner: Why don't they use Ethereum? He said they’re escaping when they hear Ethereum’s name due to high fees.</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="Tron's Network Effect" loading="lazy" width="3549" height="1920" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:3549px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E2H2I3qM3M5qFP8VRE-oj.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>Tron's Network Effect</figcaption></figure></div>
      <p>So what those crypto users want is:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Cheap Fees - this is where Ethereum failed in its earlier days</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>CEX integrations &amp; On/off ramp providers - Binance P2P is also widely used on payments and the main advantage of Binance P2P and Tron is their usage everywhere. This is so important because they need to find a way to convert their local currencies with Crypto. Unfortunately CEX’s are still the best option available here.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Customers are not happy when they hear Ethereum’s name, they just think that Ethereum is a premium chain for rich users 🙂</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If it is a self-custodial wallet, the users need easy recoverability, phishing resistance and good UX.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Being Able to Make USD Transfers Globally - It can be done via a stable coin or in the future CDBC?</p>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Gambling in Cyprus and Why Crypto is Being Used in There:</strong></p>
      <p>Gambling is legal in Cyprus. As I have talked with locals, they said that most of the casinos accept crypto payments because it is the easiest way to send and receive money if you’re coming from outside of Cyprus. I couldn’t visit the Casinos, so I don’t have numbers for how often Casinos accept payments in stable coins and gamblers choose them. Their requirements from wallets are so similar to students, they need easy on &amp; off ramp, CEX integrations, and cheap fees.</p>
      <p><strong>Some Shops Accept Crypto Payments</strong></p>
      <p>Crypto payments are also legal in Cyprus, almost 10% of shops that I visited were accepting crypto payments. I also talked with them and they said the same thing: most of the users are using Tron. Almost all of them use Binance Pay for accounting &amp; calculating taxes etc. Just because it is easy to use and Binance has a great legal form for them.</p>
      <div><figure class="rehype-figure"><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><img alt="Bitcoin Accepted here :) " loading="lazy" width="2372" height="1084" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:auto;width:2372px;max-width:100%;max-height:100%" src="https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jh4keVCY2LknFJYVXVV2k.png"><button aria-label="Zoom image" data-rmiz-btn-open="true"></button></div><figcaption>Bitcoin Accepted here :) </figcaption></figure></div>
      <p><strong>How Ethereum Can Beat Tron and Be the Main Place for Payments?</strong> First of all, I’m biased as we build a payment-focused crypto application (Clave). But as an Ethereum enthusiast, I have some views on payments and how Ethereum can beat Tron:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>L2’s&amp;CEX integrations: When we look at Tron’s success we see that Binance’s and Tether’s support for Tron helped them to lead the stable coin payments in web3. We need a similar thing for Ethereum.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Focusing on Local Communities: Yes, onboarding users to crypto was problematic in the past. But right now, we have Account Abstraction, passkeys, biometrics, and many other features to serve the best UX without giving up on decentralization.&nbsp; But we still need an important thing: local communities, especially from driving countries, need to access dollar liquidity and the only way to touch with them is by having local GTM plans similar to what Tron did in Africa.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Building a network of networks: let your users distribute the way that users send money. We allow users to send money with a link, this means that users can send money even if the recipient doesn’t have an account and the recipient will also be a user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>No more focus on L1’s execution layer, please. We need 1 cent transactions on Layer 2’s without integrating alternative Data Availability layers.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We, Clave, are trying to fill these gaps in the Ethereum ecosystem together with zkSync and we’re trying to make Ethereum payments great again :).</p>

      <div><p>One of the most pervasive conversations surrounding blockchain technology is sustainability. Blockchain networks — specifically proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin — can consume large amounts of energy. Recent estimates suggest that Bitcoin mining is currently responsible annually for an estimated 85 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (<a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_paypal/186970/Green_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">as of April 02, 2024</a>). Even with new blockchain consensus mechanisms proliferating rapidly, Bitcoin’s PoW architecture is likely to persist.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group, in a strategic collaboration with Energy Web and DMG Blockchain Solutions Inc. (“DMG”), presents an opportunity to accelerate the clean energy transition for Bitcoin mining. Just like so many other mechanisms throughout web3, we propose the use of cryptoeconomic incentives to encourage desired behavior: Bitcoin miners using low-carbon energy sources in their mining operations. The full research paper, linked below, outlines an opportunity that not only rewards Bitcoin miners for operating with sustainable energy, but also increases the likelihood of participating entities to route on-chain transactions to these specific miners.</p>
      <p>Read the full paper from the <strong><a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.paypal-corp.com%2Fimage%2FGreen_Mining_Initiative_2024.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwilburns%40paypal.com%7Cd2510d3722fc4939429608dc622c4164%7Cfb00791460204374977e21bac5f3f4c8%7C0%7C0%7C638493189460006661%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=eCx%2Fu0p3a6TNK7Y0VpN3x0W%2FMl9e8ZHGEcGnVo3IRGo%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PayPal Blockchain Research Group</a></strong>.</p>
      <h3 id="heading-incentivizing-desired-activity-with-cryptoeconomics">Incentivizing desired activity with cryptoeconomics</h3>
      <p>Rational miners are driven by cryptoeconomic incentives. They expect to be rewarded with an asset (bitcoin BTC) that is more valuable than the resources they expended to acquire that reward. Much of blockchain’s history has focused on how to get a group of disparate, individual miners to all perform honestly and responsibly in the maintenance of a decentralized ledger.</p>
      <p>Since 2008, Bitcoin has achieved the robust, secure, decentralized, and censorship-resistant maintenance of the ledger with its decentralized miner community. In other words, the fundamental cryptoeconomic structure of Bitcoin and its PoW consensus mechanism has proven successful. Now, the question is whether additional cryptoeconomic incentives can be layered on top of the fundamental PoW mechanism thereby allowing us to encourage more environmentally sustainable actions that we desire as a community.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group's partner EnergyWeb has developed a clean energy validation platform to permit Bitcoin miners to obtain low-carbon accreditation for their mining operations. These <em>green miners</em> are associated with public keys (which we refer to as <em>green keys)</em>, to which rewards can be distributed. On-chain transactions are preferentially routed to <em>green miners</em> by being broadcasted with low transaction fees, but with some BTC reward “locked” in a multisig payout address. <em>Green miners</em> will be incentivized to mine these transactions, since they will be the only ones eligible for the additional “locked” BTC reward.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s Blockchain Research Group hopes that this paper influences preferred behaviors by proposing ways in which fundamental cryptoeconomic incentives can be reapplied to improve and optimize existing, proven, strong networks. Sustainability is a significant topic of conversation for nearly every emerging and established industry in the world, and we aim to support the role of crypto in a sustainable future.</p>
